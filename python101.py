# Variables
# - Strings, letters, numbers, or any other stuff you can make with a keyboard.
# - A variable is just a fast way to refer to something else.
# - They don't make the program faster. They make it slower.
# - They just make it easier for us to write programs.

# theBestClass = "the 11-18 immersive"
# print (theBestClass)
