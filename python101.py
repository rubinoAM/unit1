# Variables
# - Strings, letters, numbers, or any other stuff you can make with a keyboard.
# - A variable is just a fast way to refer to something else.
# - They don't make the program faster. They make it slower.
# - They just make it easier for us to write programs.

# theBestClass = "the 11-18 immersive"
# print (theBestClass)

#Data Types
# - Programming languages see different types of variables differently.
# - String: English characters.
# - Numbers: Numerals.
# - Floats & Integers
# -- Floats have decimal points. Integers do not!
# - Booleans: True/False, On/Off, 1/0
# - List: A single variable with a bunch of parts (A.K.A. an array)
# - Dictionary: Variable of variables
# - Object: Super dictionaries

# - Primitive Data Types: String, Number, Boolean
